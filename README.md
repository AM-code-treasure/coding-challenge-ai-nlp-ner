# AM Coding Challenge - AI (NLP)

## The case study: Train a BERT NER Model on our Dataset

![AM NLP NER Challenge](https://github.com/AM-code-treasure/coding-challenge-ai-nlp-ner/blob/main/6_business_entity_recognition.png)

We have a dataset of several thousand annotated invoices, perfectly suited for named-entity-recognition. 
Please use this dataset, clean it and train a BERT NER model with Pytorch. How you do this, is your decision.

## Requirements

- [ ] A trained NER Model, able to detect the following categories: Invoice Issuer, Invoice Recipient, Invoice Date, Invoice Total Amount.
- [ ] The NER model needs to be build as an API. Input of the NER Model API are png-images. You need to convert these png images via an OCR into text and process the text with your NER model. The output of the API is a json, containing the detected categories. 

## Instructions

- Fork this repo
- The challenge is on!
